/*
  
  tokeniser.h --

  Split a string into an array of trigrams.

  The input string should be only lowercase latin letters and spaces
  (convert using iconv).

  Each trigram is a three-symbol tuple consisting of latters and the
  "epsilon" character used to represent spaces and beginning-of-word/end-of-
  word anchors.

  Each trigram is represented by a 16-bit integer.
